# AWS-Secure-High-Availability-Architecture-with-Observability
This project demonstrates a production-style AWS cloud architecture focused on security,
high availability, and operational observability.

The goal was to design and implement a realistic system that mirrors how modern cloud
environments are architected, secured, and operated in real-world organizations.
